<h2>Hello im Richard Hagenah</h2> 
<p>I began my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer about a year and a half ago when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I liked computers and took a web development class back in high school, then I found Kenzie Academy which was a 12 month Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. My main reason for joining Kenzie was to start a career in doing something that I would enjoy.</p>
<br />
<p>I have focused my time and effort since graduating back in July on JavaScript and React. Looking to grow with a company and bring long term value to the company and continue to grow as a developer as well as a person.</p>
