<h2>Hello im Richard Hagenah</h2> 
<p>I began my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer about a year and a half ago when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I liked computers and took a web development class back in high school, then I found Kenzie Academy which was a 12 month Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. Before joining Kenzie, i was enrolled at a different bootcamp for the month of March for UX/UI design but I struggled and couldn't really get the support I was looking for. After taking some time to process what was next for me, I started to research coding bootcamps as well as some colleges to figure out what was best for me, so wanted you to have prior coding experiences and colleges were too expensive and I didnt want to take classes that I had no interest in. My main reason for joining Kenzie was to start a career in doing something that I would enjoy and to leave my dead-end job.</p>
<br />
<p>I have focused my time and effort since graduating back in July on JavaScript and React. Looking to grow with a company and bring long term value to the company and continue to grow as a developer as well as a person.</p>
